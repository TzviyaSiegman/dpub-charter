      <h1 id="title">Digital Publishing Interest Group Charter</h1>
      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the Digital Publishing
        Interest Group is to provide a forum for experts in the digital
        publishing ecosystem of electronic journals, magazines, news, or book
        publishing (authors, creators, publishers, news organizations,
        booksellers, accessibility and internationalization specialists, etc.)
        for technical discussions towards a future vision of Digital Publishing.
        This vision has been detailed, and already discussed by the community,
        in a separate White Paper entitled <a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/">“Advancing
          Portable Documents for the Open Web Platform: EPUB+WEB”</a>; the main
        message of that vision is that the current format- and workflow-level
        separation between offline/portable (e.g., EPUB) and online (Web)
        document publishing should be diminished to zero. Whilst this Interest
        Group is not chartered to specify Recommendations, it will provide
        technical directions, identify technical issues and outline solutions
        that relevant Working Groups of the W3C will have to finalize as final
        Web standards. Some of the work will have to be done in a strong
        cooperation with existing Working Groups at W3C or at IDPF to ensure a
        full compatibility with the Open Web Platform.</p>

        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>Today’s digital publishing market is dynamic, fast-changing, and
          strong. eBooks compete with printed versions, and there is a wide
          choice of hardware and software available for eBook readers. Journals
          and magazines are also made available digitally on the Web or in
          specialized applications and, in some cases, their printed version is
          even abandoned in favor of a purely digital version. The formats used
          by eBook readers and tablets for electronic books, magazines, journals
          and educational resources are largely based on W3C Technologies, such
          as (X)HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL, MathML, or various Web API-s.</p>
        <p>The advancement of EPUB3 ensured the introduction of highly dynamic
          and interactive digital documents whose features resemble more an more
          to what the Web generally provides. This can be seen through a new
          breed of interactive books in, e.g., the educational domain, but the
          same technical possibilities have the potential of revolutionizing
          such diverse areas as journal and magazine publications (including
          scholarly journal publishing), archival of Web content, or in-house
          publishing of documentations by large corporations. The vision for the
          convergence of digital documents and the Web has been summarized in a
          separate White Paper entitled <a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/">“Advancing
            Portable Documents for the Open Web Platform: EPUB+WEB”</a> as
          follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Our vision […] is that portable documents become fully native
            citizens of the Open Web Platform. In this vision, the current
            format- and workflow-level separation between offline/portable […]
            and online […] document publishing is diminished to zero. These are
            merely two dynamic manifestations of the same publication: content
            authored with online use as the primary mode can easily be saved by
            the user for offline reading in portable document form. […]
            Publishers can choose to utilize either or both of these publishing
            modes, and users can choose either or both of these consumption
            modes. Essential features flow seamlessly between online and offline
            modes; examples include cross-references, user annotations, access
            to online databases, as well as licensing and rights management.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Turning this vision into reality, however, requires significant
          technical work. Some of the issues are already addressed in existing
          W3C Working Groups (e.g., the CSS, HTML5, or the Web Applications
          Working Groups) but it is very important that those activities take
          into account the specificities, requirements, etc., of the Digital
          Publishing Industry through feedbacks, comments, and direct
          participation in those Working Groups. There are also a number of
          technical challenges specific to this vision that may necessitate
          targeted specification work. A first set of technical challenges have
          been identified in the White Paper, and are added here for an easier
          reference:</p>

              for embracing domain-specific restrictions and extensions</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, it is not clear, at this moment, which of these (or other)
          challenges will require targeted work and which should be done in
          cooperation with existing Working Groups. In light of this, the goal
          of this Interest Group is to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide an in-depth and exhaustive overview of the technical
            challenges that should be solved to make the EPUB+WEB vision a
            reality.</li>
          <li>Determine, and take the necessary actions, whether these
            challenges should be addressed through </li>
          <ul>
            <li>new Working Groups at W3C (in which case the Interest Group
              should actively contribute to the chartering of those groups), or</li>
            <li>cooperation with other W3C groups (in which case the Interest
              Group should provide feedbacks, comments, and requirements to
              those Groups to ensure the necessary convergence, and should
              encourage members of the Interest Group to actively participate in
              those Groups), or</li>
            <li>the publication of non-normative documents, like Interest Group
              Notes, to be published by this Interest Group, or</li>
            <li>by Working Groups at other organizations, like the International
              Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) or the Book Industry Study Group
              (BISG) (in which case strong liaisons should be established with
              those groups).</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally to these work items, the Interest Group should also plan
          to have an active cooperation with the work on the EPUB 3.1 revision
          at the IDPF. This work, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bvmd_wd8Tcq6MdVd8VkL308Mpfgpsv9Aw-IAwd3g0B0/edit#">chartered</a>
          in 2015, aims to include a number of backward compatible changes to
          EPUB 3.01, adding new features and deprecating others. Many of those
          changes aim at bringing EPUB even closer to the Open Web Platform and,
          thereby, contributing to the vision of EPUB+WEB. The Interest Group
          would act as an advisory group to IDPF on the OWP related features, as
          well as a conduit to other groups at W3C. <span class="todo">Refresh
            the link to the EPUB3.1 charter when it is final!</span></p>
        The group is a continuation, under this new charter, of the Digital
        Publishing Interest Group that started in 2013 and whose original <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/02/digpubig.html">charter</a>
        expires in September 2015. That group has firmly established the
        presence of the Digital Publishing Community within W3C and, vice versa,
        the presence of W3C within the Digital Publishing Community. The results
        of the previous Interest Group will provide a strong basis for the work
        of this new Interest Group.
        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
        <br />
        <p>The group has succeeded if</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A clear migration path towards the vision expressed in the
            EPUB+WEB White Paper has been established, including a clear view of
            the technical challenges and issues to solve.</li>
          <li>A fruitful cooperation is established between the Interest Group
            and the relevant Working Groups at W3C, reflected by a successful
            harmonization between the needs of the publishing industry at large,
            and EPUB+WEB in particular, and constituents of the Open Web
            Platform. </li>
          <li>The group has successfully contributed establishing the Working
            Group(s) essential in turn the EPUB+WEB vision a reality.</li>
          <li>Members of the Interest Group join the relevant Working Groups to
            participate and possibly drive the development of the specific work
            items that are in development and are considered to be important for
            the EPUB+WEB vision.</li>
          <li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items listed in
            the <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables’</a> section.</li>
          <li>A productive and stable set of liaisons is set up between the
            Digital Publishing industry and its representative organizations
            like the IDPF, EDItEUR, or BISG, and the various W3C Working Groups.
            These liaisons should define how W3C Working Groups can request
            technical comments from those external organizations, and how those
            external organizations can convey their requirements to current and
            future Working Groups. These liaisons should remain active even when
            the Interest Group is closed.</li>
          <li>The Interest Group has provided useful advice an help to IDPF in
            developing EPUB 3.1.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
          <p>This Interest Group is not chartered to develop final

            direct participation of the interested parties.</p>
          <p>This Interest Group is not chartered to work on issues and use
            cases that are relevant exclusively to non-W3C standards and
            specifications (e.g., Unicode), although the evolution of those
            Specifications should be followed as they may influence the

        <p>This is an initial list of the activities and groups the IG will
          consider when starting its work. The goal of these liaisons is to
          ensure harmonization of the technical requirements and provide
          feedbacks. The importance of these will be evaluated during the
          lifetime of the IG; this also means that some groups may not be
          contacted if the IG does not find any issues and problems worth
          raising after all. The list of these groups, with a short description

        <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
        <p>Participation in the Digital Publishing Interest Group is open to all
          W3C Members. Individuals who wish to participate as Invited Experts
          (i.e., they do not represent a W3C Member) should refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/08/invexp.html"
            shape="rect">policy for approval of Invited Experts</a>. Invited
          Experts in this group are not granted access to Member-only
          information. Effective participation in the Interest Group is expected
          to consume one day work per week for each participant. </p>
        <p>The group may decide to create Task Forces within the Interest Group
          to concentrate on major relevant constituencies, for example
          electronic books, journal/magazine publishing, or educational
          publishing. These Task Forces may organize separate teleconferences,
          meetings, and may be responsible for one or more deliverables. </p>
        <p>There are no minimum requirements for participation in this group.
          Participants are strongly encouraged to take advantage of frequent
          opportunities to review and comment on deliverables from other groups.</p>
        <p>The Chair may call occasional meetings consistent with the <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#GeneralMeetings"
            shape="rect">W3C Process requirements for meetings</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="communication">
        <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
        <p>This group primarily conducts its work on the mailing list<span style="font-style: italic;">
            public-digipub-ig@w3.org </span><span class="toadd"></span>with <a
            href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-digipub-ig/">public
            archives</a>. Administrative tasks may be conducted in Member-only
          communications. </p>
        <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face
          meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital
            Publishing Interest Group home page</a></p>
        <p>The role of <a href="#depliaisons">dependencies and liaisons</a>
          with various external groups is fundamental to the success of this
          Interest Group; the group will therefore set up active liaisons early
          in the process to ensure that the use cases and requirements are
          provided to other groups in a timely manner.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="decisions">
        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">section
            3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
          consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after
          due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a
          decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move
          on. <br />
          <br />
          A formal vote should allow for remote asynchronous
          participation—using, for example, email and/or web-based survey
          techniques. Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or
          teleconference is to be considered provisional until 5 working days
          after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the
          group's mailing list. </p>
        <p>If the group decides to create Task Forces, these may be responsible
          for one or more deliverables. However, final decisions are taken at
          the Interest Group level as described above.</p>
        <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">Section
            3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting
          procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="patent">
        <h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Digital Publishing Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure"
            shape="rect">Section 6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the
          Interest Group does not produce Recommendation-track documents, when
          Interest Group participants review Recommendation-track specifications
          from Working Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply.</p>
        <p>For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/" shape="rect">W3C
            Patent Policy Implementation</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="about">About this Charter</h2>

        this document or the provisions of any charter and the W3C Process, the
